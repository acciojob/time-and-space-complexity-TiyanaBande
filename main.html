	<h1>Time, Space Complexity</h1>
	<p> Time complexity
       Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the length of the input. It gives us an idea of the algorithm's efficiency and how it scales with larger inputs. It is usually expressed using Big O notation.
		Efficient
		Efficiency in complexity refers to how well an algorithm performs in terms of time and space as the input size grows. An efficient algorithm is one that runs faster and uses less memory compared to other algorithms that solve the same problem.

		Space Complexity
        Space complexity refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses as a function of the input size. It's an important measure alongside time complexity to evaluate the efficiency of an algorithm. Space complexity includes both the space used by the inputs and the auxiliary space used by the algorithm.
		Understanding O(n) Space Complexity
        When an algorithm has a space complexity of O(n), it means that the amount of memory it requires grows linearly with the size of the input. This linear growth signifies that for each additional unit of input, a proportional amount of memory is required.
